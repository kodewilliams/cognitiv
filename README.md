“An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.”  — Benjamin Franklin
“The central event of the twentieth century is the overthrow of matter. In technology, economics, and the politics of nations, wealth in the form of physical resources is steadily declining in value and significance. The powers of mind are everywhere ascendant over the brute force of things.” — George Gilder 
The value of knowledge isn’t static. It changes as a function of how valuable other people consider it and how rare it is.
The long-term effects of intellectual complacency are just as insidious as the long-term effects of not exercising, eating well, or sleeping enough.
We often believe we can’t afford the time it takes, but the opposite is true: None of us can afford not to learn. Learning is no longer a luxury; it’s a necessity.
1.	Find the time to read.
2.	Stay consistent with that time.
3.	Increase the results from each hour.
